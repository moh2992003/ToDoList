# To-Do List Application

This is a simple to-do list application that allows users to add tasks, set priorities, and track their completion status. Tasks are stored locally and displayed on the page dynamically.

- **Start Time**: Tasks display the time they were initialized.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete tasks by clicking on the recycle icon next to each task.
- **Local Storage**: Task data is stored locally, ensuring persistence even after page refresh.
